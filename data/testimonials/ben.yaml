text: "Having grown up as an atheist, I became a Christian at University in 1996. I think Jesus is simply wonderful, I love the Bible and I want to teach it faithfully to others. I studied theology and pastoral studies at Oak Hill College from 2006-2009. I am married to Elisabeth and we have two children, Joseph and Chloe. I love chess, badminton and my family all love Strictly Come Dancing."
