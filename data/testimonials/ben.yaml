text: "Having grown up as an atheist, Jesus rescued this proud sinner in 1996 while at university. Christ has proved Himself to be supremely wonderful: He has given me a glorious destiny and is so patient day by day to lead and transform me by his Holy Spirit. He united me in marriage to Elisabeth and gave us two children: Joseph and Chloe. After getting me through some theological study at Oak Hill College, He even led me to come to Longmeadow in 2009 to join the eldership team. Somehow He uses little me each week to preach his amazing Word, the Bible, to His beloved people. My other great loves are to keep fit and to watch action films and Strictly Come Dancing."
