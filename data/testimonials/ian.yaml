  I've been coming to Longmeadow for over ten years now and was struck by the warm and friendly welcome I received when I 
  first came along. In that time I have seen God work through my mistakes, often in ways I could not have imagined. It has 
  also been great to know new people from all around the world when they have joined or visited the church. Crystal Palace 
  supporters are a rare thing in these parts, but there are at least two in Stevenage - myself and John, another elder. 
  I'm also a bit of a steam train geek and enjoy the outdoors.
