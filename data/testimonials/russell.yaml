text: "I grew up in a Christian family, for which I''m very grateful as it helped me to get to know Jesus myself from an early age. Life since then has been full of opportunities and challenges to trust him more and experience his love for me. I''m married to Steph and we have three children, who alternately put up with or participate in my love of watching sport, playing games and searching for a successor to The West Wing."
